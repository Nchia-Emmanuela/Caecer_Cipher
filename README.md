# Caecer_Cipher
## Encryption and Decryption in Python
### Caecer cipher uses a single key for both Encryption and Decryption of text
### Encryption shifts the letters of the alphabet a number of times to the right, depending on the key. 
### e.g key = 3, letter to be encrypted = A, Encryption = D.
### Decryption works same as encryption, but this time we are shifting a number of times to the left of the alphabet depending on the key
